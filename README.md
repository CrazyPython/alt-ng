`alt-ng` is a Flux implementation that removes all the boilerplate traditionally associated to managing data. `alt-ng` does not use
switch statements, is based on JavaScript classes, and supports Promises as first-class citizens. Check out
[the tutorial](http://alt-ng.js.org/tutorial/), or jump straight into the [documentation](http://alt-ng.koliseo.com/doc/).

### Why you should be using alt-ng

* [Promises](http://alt-ng.koliseo.com/tutorial/promises) are first class citizens
* **Lightweight**: A lot of code has been removed from the original alt implementation to make it even more lightweight
* **No constants or switch statements**: Removes all the boilerplate of traditional Flux frameworks
* **Unidirectional flow of information**: Enforces the basic principles in [flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html)
* Follows the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action/) standard.
* Designed to work in both the **client and server side**
* Actively maintained and being used in production.
* Based on ES6 classes

      <h2>100% Flux</h2>
      <p>
        A true flux compliant library in a very small size. Actions and Stores are real simple to configure, 
        without the boilerplate traditionally associated to flux implementations.
      </p>

      <h2>Server Side Rendering       </h2>
      <p>
        Alt comes with support for building client or server-side applications right out of the box.
      </p>

    <div class="column one-third">
      <h2>ES6</h2>
      <p>
        Although optional, Alt is meant to work with ES6 leveraging classes, Promises, and more.

      <h2>Simple</h2>
      <p>
        Do away with defining constants, building your own boilerplate dispatchers, and ugly switch statements.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column one-third">
      <h2>Flexible</h2>
      <p>
        Feel like ditching singletons and using multiple instances of each Store, or using reducers to handle state changes? No problem.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column one-third">
      <h2>Snapshots</h2>
      <p>
        At any point in time you can take a snapshot of the entire application state and then reload it later. 
        This opens the door for including state in your HTML file, easier debugging, and more.
